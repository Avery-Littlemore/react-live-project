# Exercise
- Create a progress bar that is 200px wide, 20px tall and animates from 0 to 100% of its width in 5 seconds (20% every 1 second). No CSS animations - use JS to advance the loading bar until 100%.
- Create a button that adds progress bars to the DOM on click
- Update your code so that only 1 progress bar can be animating at a time, but you can still add progress bars to the DOM on button click. The next progress bar should begin loading once the previous bar has completed loading.
- Update your code so that 5 progress bars can be animating at a time, but you can still add progress bars to the DOM on button click. A bar should only begin loading if fewer than 5 are currently loading.
- Add a button next to each progress bar to remove the progress bar from the DOM when clicked
